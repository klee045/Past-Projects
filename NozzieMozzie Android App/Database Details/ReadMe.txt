Database I am currently using is XAMPP Local Host.
This means that all data are only stored in my device, not an online server. 
XAMPP simulates an online database server by using weblinks, so that if we do have a working server, we can simply replace the localhost weblink to the server weblink.

To use XAMPP on your own device, follow this tutorial:

This tutorial is for unity, but the usage and installation of XAMMP is the same.

Stored in the same directory as this ReadMe file are 3 .php file that is used to run SQL commands to retrieve database results.
These .php file needs to be stored in database server and will be called by the java code. 
If you are using XAMPP, these files need to be placed under C:\xampp\htdocs
